# SNES platform notes (from Super Mario World)

## Formats (code in `cleanroom/snes/`)
- **Tiles** (`tiles.py`): planar 8x8, 2bpp = 16 B, 3bpp = 24 B (planes 0/1 interleaved by row, then plane 2), 4bpp = 32 B.
  `decode -> (n,8,8)` index arrays, `sheet/unsheet` = 16 tiles per row.
- **LC_LZ2** (`lz2.py`): commands direct / byte fill / word fill / increasing fill / back copy (big-endian absolute offset), `0xFF` ends. Our encoder is greedy; size differs from retail, which is fine when the port stores blocks with their own lengths.
- **BRR** (`brr.py`): 9-byte blocks, 16 samples each, 4 filters, end + loop flags in the header. `encode(pcm, loop_block)` picks shift/filter per block by error; first block and the loop block use filter 0 so the loop is self-contained.
- **Palettes**: 15-bit BGR words. Kept at 3 bits per channel.
- **SPC sample bank** (SMW): `[len, addr=0x8000][directory: start, loop per instrument][len, addr=0x8100][BRR blob][tail]`. Sizes and offsets must stay equal (ARAM layout is fixed by the engine).

## Traps
- A sheet's bit depth is not in the file. SMW: GFX00-31 are 3bpp, 28-2B and 2F are 2bpp (layer 3 / fonts), **GFX32 (player) is 4bpp**, GFX33 (animated tiles) is 3bpp. Wrong depth still decodes: check by eye once (dirty room).
- The 2-bit alpha fact = which pixels are index 0. A white-on-transparent logo therefore survives as its silhouette. Background tiles are fully opaque, so only the colour grid describes them.
- Fonts are 8x8 cells: stroke fonts turn to mush, use `cleanroom/gfx/pixfont.py` (5x7 pixel face, thin and bold) and check for exact glyph collisions with the taint scan; a plain bold 5x7 face collided with the retail message font on 23 glyphs, the thin face collides on none.
- Upstream snesrev sources are stored CRLF: normalise before patching.
- Emscripten + SDL2 + ASYNCIFY: SDL sleeps inside `SDL_RenderPresent` behind indirect calls. Either instrument everything (slow, large) or set the hint `SDL_EMSCRIPTEN_ASYNCIFY=0`, use `-sASYNCIFY_IGNORE_INDIRECT=1` and yield only in your own frame wait called directly from `main`.
- Editing Python through shell heredocs corrupts `\n` escapes: use the editor tool.

## Commands (SMW)
```
